#No training, no big O, no prolog
**nlp_compromise** is a Natural-Language-Processing library *in javascript* that's small-enough for the browser, and quick-enough to run on keypress :two_men_holding_hands:

it does [tons of fancy things](https://rawgit.com/spencermountain/nlp_compromise/master/client_side/index.html). it's smaller than jquery, and scores 82% on the [Penn treebank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/).

##Justification
If the 80-20 rule applies generically, a ''96-4'' rule applies when working with language - by [Zipfs law](http://www.businessinsider.com/zipfs-law-and-the-most-common-words-in-english-2013-10):
>The **[top 10 words](http://www.businessinsider.com/zipfs-law-and-the-most-common-words-in-english-2013-10)** account for 25% of used language.

>The **top 100 words** account for 50% of used language.

>The **top 50,000 words** account for 95% of used language.

On the [Penn treebank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/), for example, this is possible:

* a 1 thousand word lexicon: **45% accuracy**
* ... and falling back to nouns: **70% accuracy**
* ... and some suffix regexes: **74% accuracy**
* ... and some basic sentence-level postprocessing: **81% accuracy**

The process is to get curated data, find the patterns, list the exceptions. Bada bing, bada boom.
In this way a satisfactory NLP library can be built with breathtaking lightness.

### Details
#### Tags
the [industry-standard parts-of-speech](https://github.com/spencermountain/nlp_comprimise/blob/master/lib/pos/data/parts_of_speech.js)
```javascript
  "verb": [
    "VB  - verb, generic (eat)",
    "VBD  - past-tense verb (ate)",
    "VBN  - past-participle verb (eaten)",
    "VBP  - infinitive verb (eat)",
    "VBZ  - present-tense verb (eats, swims)",
    "CP  - copula (is, was, were)",
    "VBG  - gerund verb (eating,winning)"
  ],
  "adjective": [
    "JJ  - adjective, generic (big, nice)",
    "JJR  - comparative adjective (bigger, cooler)",
    "JJS  - superlative adjective (biggest, fattest)"
  ],
  "adverb": [
    "RB  - adverb (quickly, softly)",
    "RBR  - comparative adverb (faster, cooler)",
    "RBS  - superlative adverb (fastest (driving), coolest (looking))"
  ],
  "noun": [

    "NNS  - plural noun (dogs, foxes)",

    "DA  - date (june 5th, 1998)",
    "NU  - number (89, half-million)"
  ]
```

####Lexicon
The conjugate methods are quick and accurate enough that we can actually begin with a very small lexicon, and build it out.

For example, it lists the 300 top verbs, then blasts-out all of their 1200+ derived forms.

####Contractions
when it's grammatically necessary, the parser puts a 'silent token' into the phrase. Otherwise it would get misrepresented.
```javascript
nlp.pos("i'm good.")
// [{
// 	text:"i'm",
// 	normalised:"i",
// 	pos:"PRP"
// },
// {
// 	text:"",
// 	normalised:"am",
// 	pos:"CP"
// },
// {
// 	text:"good.",
// 	normalised:"good",
// 	pos:"JJ"
// }]
```
####Tokenization
in post-processing, neighbours with the same part of speech are merged together (It skips this if there is punctuation involved). To turn this off, set options= {dont_combine:true}
```javascript
nlp.pos("tony hawk won")
//tony hawk   NN
//won   VB
nlp.pos("tony hawk won", {dont_combine:true})
//tony   NN
//hawk   NN
//won   VB
```
<!-- ### Named-Entity Recognizing
```javascript
nlp.spot("Tony Hawk said he was very happy")
// ["Tony Hawk"]
```
-->

## Syllable hyphenization
70% on the [moby hyphenization corpus](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/mhyph10.zip)  0.5k
```javascript
nlp.syllables("hamburger")
//[ 'ham', 'bur', 'ger' ]
```

## US-UK Localization
```javascript
nlp.americanize("favourite")
//favorite
nlp.britishize("synthesized")
//synthesised
```
## N-gram
```javascript
nlp.ngram("She sells seashells by the seashore. The shells she sells are surely seashells.", {min_count:1, max_size:5})
// [{ word: 'she sells', count: 2, size: 2 }, ...
options.min_count // throws away seldom-repeated grams. defaults to 1
options.max_gram // prevents the result from becoming gigantic. defaults to 5
```

### Date parsing
```javascript
nlp.dates("I married April for the 2nd time on June 5th 1998 ")
// { text: 'June 5th 1998',
//   from: { year: '1998', month: '06', day: '05' },
//   to: {} }
```
### Number parsing
```javascript
nlp.to_number("two thousand five hundred and sixty")
//2560
nlp.to_number("ten and a half million")
//15000000
```
### Unicode Normalisation
a hugely-ignorant, and widely subjective transliteration of latin, cryllic, greek unicode characters to english ascii.
```javascript
nlp.normalise("Björk")
//Bjork

nlp.denormalise("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", {percentage:50})
// The ɋӈїck brown fox juӎÞs over tӊe laζy dog
```
