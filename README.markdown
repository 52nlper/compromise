**nlp_comprimise** is a quick and light Natural-Language-Processing library in javascript that is small enough to be used in the browser, and quick enough and run on keypress.

It uniquely trades the 'last 15%' accuracy for speed, slightness, and ease-of-use. You can roll it into anything, without thinking, and get competitive results. No training, no configuring, no prolog.

Instead, it's a single javascript file that's smaller than jQuery, with results in the mid-80% range.

this library is under active development (April-May 2014)

#Justification
A working NLP library can be satisfactory with a breathtaking lightness.
By [Zipfs law](http://www.businessinsider.com/zipfs-law-and-the-most-common-words-in-english-2013-10):
>The [top 10 words](http://www.businessinsider.com/zipfs-law-and-the-most-common-words-in-english-2013-10) account for 25% of our language.

>The top 100 words account for 50% of our language.

>The top 50,000 words account for 95% of our language.

The trade-offs for processing english are quite aggressive.

On the [Penn treebank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/), for example, the following is possible:

* choosing all nouns: **33% correct**
* using a 1 thousand word lexicon: **45% correct**
* using a 1 thousand word lexicon, and falling back to nouns: **70% correct**
* using a 1 thousand word lexicon, common suffix regexes, and falling back to nouns: **74% correct**

The process has been to get the curated data, find the patterns, list the exceptions.
