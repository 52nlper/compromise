#WElcome, good person

I am very welcoming to all pull requests, and feature requests in all forms.
NLP is a solvable problem in scale, and all forms of input are gracious and lovely. I am also friendly and approachable. There is lots of work to be done.

* code is in ```/src```
* text is broken into 'Section' -> 'Sentence' -> 'Token', each with their relevant methods
* the various parts-of-speech have a 'parent form' of [noun, verb, adverb, adjective, or value], each with their relevant methods (in ```/src/parents```)
* unit tests are in ```/tests/unit_test.js``` and can be run with 'npm test'
* 'grunt' command joins all various scripts into a client-side js file
* casual versioning/publishing with semvar

check out ```./known_issues.md``` or the unit tests that have been ... commented out.

have a nice day
