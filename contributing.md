#WElcome, good person

I am very welcoming to all pull requests, and feature requests in all forms.
NLP is a solvable problem in scale, and all forms of input are gracious and lovely. I am also friendly and approachable.

* code is in /src
* arbitrary text is broken into 'Section' -> 'Sentence' -> 'Token', each with their relevant methods
* the various parts-of-speech have a 'parent form' of [noun, verb, adverb, adjective, or value], each with their relevant methods (in /src/parents)
* unit tests are in /tests/unit_test.js and can be run with 'npm test'
* 'grunt' command concatenates all various scripts into a client-side js file

check out ```./known_issues.md``` or unit tests that have been commented out. There is lots of work to be done.

have a nice day
